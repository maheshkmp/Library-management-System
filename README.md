This project serves as a foundational base for building a RESTful API using Django and Django REST framework. It demonstrates essential components for creating a functional API, including model definition, serialization, and view implementation. The Book model in this example includes fields for title, author, and published_date, providing a clear structure for managing book records. The project includes API endpoints to list, create, retrieve, update, and delete books, offering a solid starting point for developing more complex APIs and easily extending the setup to meet various requirements.
